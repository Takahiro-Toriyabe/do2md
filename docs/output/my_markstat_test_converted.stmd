% Quantiles in Stata and R
% Takahiro Toriyabe
% `s c(current_date)`

Stata and R compute percentiles differently. Let us load the `auto`
dataset and compute the 75th percentile of `price` using Stata's `centile`

```s
    sysuse auto, clear
    centile price, centile(75)
```

We find that the 75-th percentile is `s r(c_1)`.
